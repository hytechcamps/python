# Turtle Challenges
Play around with the turtles to create something cool! Feel free to start from the challenges below, or do something completely different.

## Pentagon
Update the code so that the turtle draws a pentagon instead of a square.

### Code to Update
```python
for x in range(4):
  shelly.forward(100)
  shelly.right(90)
```

_HINT: Update the numbers from the square loop (the `4` and the `90`) so that the turtle draws the correct number of sides, and turns the correct angle each time_

## Other Shapes
Make the turtle draw the following shapes:
- Diamond
- Hexagon
- Septagon
- Parallelogram
- Trapezoid

Try to keep each shape separate, so they do not overlap.

## Complete Drawing
Use a turtle to draw a whole picture, like a house, a flower, an animal, a tree, or anything else that comes to mind!

## Turtle Examples
Check out the [Turtle Examples](TurtleExamples.md) to see some cool turtle features. Try copying and pasting some of the code, and updating it to create something unique. Change any of the numbers or colors to see how it affects the drawing!
