# Programming with Python Workshop
This workshop introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

## Icebreaker
Give students some time to play around with the [turtle drawing tool](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Turtle-Drawing). At the end of that time, allow volunteers to share their drawings. Other students should have an opportunity to introduce themselves as well.

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) to introduce students to Python.

## Code-Along Activity
For the [code-along activity](TurtleCodeAlong.md), get into Python and start building something with turtle graphics.

## Challenges & Examples
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md). They can also look at the [examples](TurtleExamples.md) for inspiration.

## Sharing Work
Students can save and share their work by following [these instructions](SharingWork.md).

If there is nothing else to do and the students are not active, feel free to end the workshop early.
