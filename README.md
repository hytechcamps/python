# Programming with Python Workshop
This workshop introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

### Description
Students will learn the basics of computer science using the Python programming language. Python is a popular multi-purpose language used by professional and hobbyist developers alike. The goal is for students to gain a high-level overview of essential programming topics while creating fun programs in Python.

## Icebreaker
Give students some time to play around with the [turtle drawing tool](https://replit.com/@HylandOutreach/Turtle-Drawing). At the end of that time, allow volunteers to share their drawings. Other students should have an opportunity to introduce themselves as well.

## Lecture
The lecture uses a [PowerPoint presentation](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) to introduce students to Python.

## Kahoot Quiz
Facilitate the [Kahoot quiz](https://create.kahoot.it/share/python-quiz/e5a7b299-5de3-4020-8fb3-ad4bffa9e78f) to test student retention from the lecture. Most of the content covered in the lecture will not be directly relevant to the code-along activity, so the results are not incredibly important.

## Code-Along Activity
For the [code-along activity](TurtleCodeAlong.md), get into Python and start building something with turtle graphics.

## Challenges & Examples
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md). They can also look at the [examples](TurtleExamples.md) for inspiration.

## Sharing Work
Students can save and share their work by following [these instructions](SharingWork.md).

If there is nothing else to do and the students are not active, feel free to end the workshop early.
